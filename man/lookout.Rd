\title{Lookout probabilities}
\usage{
lookout(object, threshold_probability = 0.95, ...)

\method{lookout}{default}(
  object,
  threshold_probability = min(0.95, 1 - 5/NROW(y)),
  h = kde_bandwidth(y),
  H = kde_bandwidth(y),
  ...
)

\method{lookout}{lm}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A model object or a numerical data set.}

\item{threshold_probability}{Probability threshold when computing the POT model for the log scores.
When \code{object} is a numerical data set, this value is only used if there are more than 100 observations.
If there are fewer than 25 observations, no POT model is computed and a warning is given.
For between 25 and 100 observations, the threshold probability is set to
\code{1 - 5/NROW(y)}.}
}
\value{
A numerical vector containing the lookout probabilities
}
\description{
Compute leave-one-out log score probabilities using a
Generalized Pareto distribution.
}
\details{
If the first argument is a numerical vector or matrix, then
a kernel density estimate is computed and the probabilities are computed
from the leave-one-out kde scores. Otherwise the model is used to compute
residuals, and the probabilities are computed from the leave-one-out residuals.

\title{Lookout probabilities}
\usage{
lookout(log_scores, log_loo_scores = log_scores, threshold_probability = 0.95)
}
\arguments{
\item{log_scores}{Numerical vector of log scores}

\item{log_loo_scores}{Optional numerical vector of leave-one-out log scores}

\item{threshold_probability}{Probability threshold when computing the POT model for the log scores.}
}
\value{
A numerical vector containing the lookout probabilities
}
\description{
Compute leave-one-out log score probabilities using a
Generalized Pareto distribution. These give the probability of each observation
being an anomaly.
}
\details{
If the log_loo_scores are not available, the log scores are used
to compute the anomaly probabilities.

\examples{
# Univariate data
tibble(
  y = c(5, rnorm(49)),
  logscores = log_scores(y),
  loglooscores = log_scores(y, loo = TRUE),
  lookout = lookout(logscores, loglooscores)
)
# Bivariate data
tibble(
  x = rnorm(50),
  y = c(5, rnorm(49)),
  logscores = log_scores(y),
  loglooscores = log_scores(y, loo = TRUE),
  lookout = lookout(logscores, loglooscores)
)
# Using a regression model
shiraz <- wine_reviews |> filter(variety \%in\% c("Shiraz", "Syrah"))
fit_wine <- lm(log(price) ~ points, data = shiraz)
shiraz |>
  mutate(
    logscore = log_scores(fit_wine),
    loglooscore = log_scores(fit_wine, loo = TRUE),
    lookout_prob = lookout(logscore, loglooscore)
  ) |>
  arrange(lookout_prob)

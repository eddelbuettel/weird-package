\title{Produce ggplot of densities from distributional objects in 1 or 2 dimensions}
\usage{
gg_density(
  object,
  prob = seq(9)/10,
  hdr = NULL,
  show_points = FALSE,
  show_mode = FALSE,
  show_anomalies = FALSE,
  colors = c("#0072b2", "#D55E00", "#009E73", "#CC79A7", "#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#F0E442"),
  alpha = NULL,
  jitter = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{distribution object from the distributional package or
\code{\link{dist_kde}}()}

\item{prob}{Probability of the HDRs to be drawn.}

\item{hdr}{Character string describing how the HDRs are to be shown. Options
are "none", "fill", "points" and "contours" (the latter only for bivariate plots).
If \code{NULL}, then "none" is used for univariate distributions and "contours" for bivariate.}

\item{show_points}{If \code{TRUE}, then individual observations are plotted.}

\item{show_mode}{If \code{TRUE}, then the mode of the distribution is shown as a
point.}

\item{show_anomalies}{If \code{TRUE}, then the observations with surprisal
probabilities less than 0.01 are shown in red.}

\item{colors}{Color palette to use. If there are more than
\code{length(colors)} distributions, they are recycled. Default is the
Okabe-Ito color palette.}

\item{alpha}{Transparency of points. Ignored if \code{show_points} is \code{FALSE}.
Defaults to min(1, 500/n), where n is the number of observations plotted.}

\item{jitter}{For univariate distributions, when \code{jitter} is \code{TRUE} and
\code{show_points} is TRUE, a small amount of vertical jittering is applied to the
observations. Ignored for bivariate distributions.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object.

\description{
Produce ggplot of densities from distributional objects in 1 or 2 dimensions
}
\details{
This function produces a ggplot of a density from a distributional object.
For univariate densities, it produces a line plot of the density function, with
an optional ribbon showing some highest density regions (HDRs) and/or the observations.
For bivariate densities, it produces ah HDR contour plot of the density function, with
the observations optionally shown as points.
The mode can also be drawn as a point.
The combination of \code{hdr = "fill"}, \code{show_points = TRUE},
\code{show_mode = TRUE}, and \code{prob = c(0.5, 0.99)} is equivalent to showing
HDR boxplots.

\examples{
# Univariate densities
kde <- dist_kde(c(rnorm(500), rnorm(500, 4, .5)))
gg_density(kde,
  hdr = "fill", prob = c(0.5, 0.95), color = "#c14b14",
  show_mode = TRUE, show_points = TRUE, jitter = TRUE
)
c(dist_normal(), kde) |>
  gg_density(hdr = "fill", prob = c(0.5, 0.95))
# Bivariate density
tibble(y1 = rnorm(5000), y2 = y1 + rnorm(5000)) |>
  dist_kde() |>
  gg_density(show_points = TRUE, alpha = 0.1, hdr = "fill")

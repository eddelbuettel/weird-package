## Overview

The weird package contains functions and data used in the book [*That's Weird: Anomaly Detection Using R*](https://OTexts.com/weird/) by Rob J Hyndman. It also loads several packages needed to do the analysis described in the book. These packages work with the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) set of packages, sharing common data representations and API design.

## Installation

You can install the development version of weird from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("robjhyndman/weird-package")
```

## Usage

`library(weird)` will load the following packages:

* [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org), for data manipulation.
* [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org), for data visualisation.
* [ks](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ks), for fitting models and producing forecasts.

You also get a condensed summary of conflicts with other packages you have loaded:

```{r usage}

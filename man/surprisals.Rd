\arguments{
\item{object}{A model or numerical data set}

\item{probability}{Should surprisal probabilities be computed, or the
surprisal values?}

\item{approximation}{Character string specifying the approximation to use in
computing the surprisal probabilities. Ignored if \code{probability = FALSE}. :
\code{none} specifies that no approximation is to be used;
\code{gpd} specifies that  the Generalized Pareto distribution should be used;
while \code{empirical} specifies that the probabilities should be estimated empirically.}

\item{threshold_probability}{Probability threshold when computing the GPD
approximation. This is the probability below which the GPD is fitted. Only
used if \code{approximation = "gpd"}).}

\item{...}{Other arguments are passed to the appropriate method.}

\item{distribution}{A distribution object. If not provided, a kernel density
estimate is computed from the data \code{object}.}

}
\value{
A numerical vector containing the surprisals or surprisal probabilities.

\description{
Compute surprisals or surprisal probabilities from a model or a
data set. A surprisal is given by \eqn{s = -\log f(y)} where \eqn{f} is the
density or probability mass function of the estimated or assumed distribution,
and \eqn{y} is an observation. A surprisal probability is the probability of
a surprisal at least as extreme as \eqn{s}.

The surprisal probabilities may be computed in three different ways.
\enumerate{
\item Given the same distribution that was used to compute the surprisal values.
Under this option, surprisal probabilities are equal to 1 minus the
coverage probability of the largest HDR that contains each value. Surprisal
probabilities smaller than 1e-6 are returned as 1e-6.
\item Using a Generalized Pareto Distribution fitted to the most extreme
surprisal values (those with probability less than \code{threshold_probability}).
This option is used if \code{approximation = "gpd"}. For surprisal values with
probability less than \code{threshold_probability}, the value of
\code{threshold_probability} is returned. Under this option, the distribution is
used for computing the surprisal values but not for determining their
probabilities. Due to extreme value theory, the resulting probabilities should
be relatively insensitive to the distribution used in computing the surprisal
values.
\item Empirically as the proportion of observations with greater surprisal values.
This option is used when \code{approxiation = "empirical"}. This is also
insensitive to the distribution used in computing the surprisal values.
}
}
\details{
If no distribution is provided, a kernel density estimate is
computed. The leave-one-out surprisals (or LOO surprisals) are obtained by
estimating the kernel density estimate using all other observations.
